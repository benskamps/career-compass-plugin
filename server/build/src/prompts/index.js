**Requirements:**
- Match the language and keywords from the posting exactly where truthful
- Lead with a strong summary that bridges my experience to this specific role
- Prioritize achievements most relevant to this posting (use impact metrics)
- Use clean formatting: no tables, no columns, no graphics (ATS-safe)
- Industry-agnostic: adapt terminology to match the posting's domain
- Be truthful — only include things from my actual career history
- Surface transferable skills even if the industry differs
- Flag any gaps honestly but frame positively
- Mark anything that needs my confirmation with a [confirm: ...] placeholder

Start by reading career://full, then produce the complete resume.

3. **Negotiation strategy** — What to push on, in what order, and why
4. **Opening script** — Exact words to use when countering, resting only on reasons that are true for me
5. **Concession plan** — What to give up if they push back, and what to hold firm on
6. **Alternative asks** — Non-salary items to request if base is fixed (signing bonus, equity cliff, remote days, title)
7. **Roleplay** — Play the hiring manager responding to my counter, then coach me through it

Then ask me if I want to do a full negotiation roleplay.

2. **Capture the durable signal** — call \`capture_insight\` (type \`interview_insight\`, this company/role, honest \`sentiment\`) with the one or two things worth keeping; include any recurring strength or gap as a \`signals\` entry
3. **Advance the pipeline** — if the stage changed, propose the \`pipeline_update\` to make (ask before writing)
4. **Thank-you notes** — for each interviewer my notes name, draft a 4-sentence thank-you that quotes or refers to one specific thing from my own notes above about that conversation. Use only what my notes say: if they give nothing specific for someone, write \`[confirm: one thing you discussed with <name>]\` instead of inventing a topic. If my notes name no interviewers, draft one note with \`[confirm: interviewer name]\`. Then propose \`pipeline_update\` with \`followUpDue: "${tomorrow()}"\` (tomorrow)${applicationId ? ` on application \`${applicationId}\`` : ""}, so my daily digest reminds me if the notes aren't sent; ask before writing
5. **Prep the next step** — run \`interview_arc\` for what likely comes next, and give me two or three things to do before then

Be honest — if it went badly, record that plainly; a hard debrief is the most useful kind.

3. **The honest read** — one thing that is working I should do more of, one that is not I should change
4. **Next week's focus** — the single highest-leverage bet for the coming week
5. **Capture it** — propose one \`capture_insight\` (type \`note\` or \`fit_signal\`) recording the week's durable takeaway, so next month's retro can see the trend (ask before writing)

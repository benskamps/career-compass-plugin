/**
 * The one line (or paragraph) the MCP server prints to stderr on start.
 *
 * When stdin is a pipe, an MCP client launched us and one terse line is right.
 * When stdin is a TTY, a person typed `career-compass-mcp` into a terminal —
 * usually straight from the README — and the old one-liner left them looking at
 * a cursor that never moved, with no way to know this process is meant to be
 * launched by Claude, or how to get out. Orient them and name the exit.
 *
 * Pure so the TTY branch can be tested without a TTY.

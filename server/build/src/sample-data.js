 * taken from it, and `CAREER_DATA_PATH=data/example` is the documented way to
 * see the dashboard with something in it. Every date in it was written by hand
 * to represent mid-June 2026 — a panel "coming up" on the 17th, a follow-up
 * four days past due. Nothing ages those, so the demo curdles: within weeks the
 * interviews have already happened, the follow-ups are months overdue, and the
 * first impression of a job-search tool is a search that was abandoned.
 *
 * Rather than re-date the YAML on a schedule (which only moves the expiry), the
 * dates are shifted at read time by the distance between {@link sampleAnchor}
 * — the sample's own notion of "today" — and the real today. The relative shape
 * the sample was authored with is exactly preserved: the panel is still three
 * days out, the rejection still landed a week ago. The files on disk are never
 * touched, and only the copy inside this package is affected: a user's own data
 * goes through untouched, whatever dates it has.

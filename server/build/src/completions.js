 * Argument completion, served from the user's own YAML.
 *
 * Every other argument in this server is something the model can reason its way
 * to. `id` is the one it cannot: an opaque string that exists only on the user's
 * disk. Without completion the model's options are to call `pipeline_view`
 * first and burn a round trip, or to guess — and a guessed id fails a
 * *destructive* update, which is the worst place to be wrong.
 *
 * This is a genuinely MCP-shaped feature. A web form has the list because it
 * rendered it; a CLI has it because you tab. A tool call has no such affordance
 * unless the server offers one, and the server is the only thing that can,
 * because it is the only participant holding the file.
 *
 * ── Failure posture ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Completion is advisory. A host that does not implement `completion/complete`
 * simply never asks, and every tool behaves exactly as before — this feature
 * fails *silently*, not misleadingly, which is why it is worth shipping ahead of
 * anything whose value is contingent on host support.
 *
 * It must also never throw. A completion request arriving while the pipeline is
 * mid-write, corrupt, or absent has to answer "no suggestions" rather than
 * surface an error into a UI affordance the user did not deliberately invoke.

 * the id prefix would fail the obvious query "acme" and there is nothing human
 * in the id to match against at all. Match across id, company and role; prefix
 * hits sort
 * above substring hits, then the most recently updated first, because the thing

/**
 * The completable `id` variable for the `career://pipeline/{id}` template.
 *
 * ── Why this lives on a resource template and not on a tool argument ────────
 *
 * The obvious place for this is `pipeline_update`'s `id` argument, and that was
 * the first implementation. It does nothing. MCP's `completion/complete` accepts
 * exactly two reference types — `ref/prompt` and `ref/resource` — and there is
 * no `ref/tool`. Wrapping a tool's input schema in `completable()` type-checks,
 * registers, and is never once consulted; a real stdio client asking for
 * completion got `-32601 Method not found`, because with nothing completable in
 * a prompt or a template the SDK never even installs the handler.
 *
 * A resource template is the seat that works, and it is the better feature
 * anyway: it makes each application individually addressable
 * (`career://pipeline/a1b2c3d4`) so a host can attach one application to a
 * conversation instead of the whole pipeline, and the id is completable while
 * the user picks it.

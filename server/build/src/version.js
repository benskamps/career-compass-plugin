 * Single source of truth for the package version.
 *
 * There used to be three: `package.json`, a string literal in `src/server.ts`
 * (reported to every MCP client in the `initialize` handshake), and an
 * assertion literal in `src/__tests__/server-e2e.test.ts`. Nothing tied them
 * together, so bumping the package silently left the server introducing itself
 * with the previous version — a lie a client has no way to detect — while the
 * e2e test went red for a reason unrelated to any real defect and pushed you
 * toward "just update the literal."
 *
 * Both the CLI and the MCP server now resolve the version from package.json at
 * runtime, and version-truth.test.ts locks the handshake to it.
 *
 * Returns "unknown" only when package.json is genuinely missing or unreadable,
 * which in a published install would mean a corrupt tarball.

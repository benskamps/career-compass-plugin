**Instructions for Claude:**
Classify this email and extract structured data:

### Classification
- **Type:** one of: recruiter_outreach | application_confirmation | interview_invite | technical_assessment | rejection | offer | reference_request | networking | unknown
- **Urgency:** high (response needed today) | medium (respond within 2 days) | low (FYI only)
- **Sentiment:** positive | neutral | negative

### Extracted Data
- **Company:**
- **Role:**
- **Contact name:**
- **Contact title:**
- **Contact email:**
- **Date/time mentioned:** (for interviews or deadlines)
- **Salary mentioned:** (if any)

### Suggested Pipeline Action
- Which application does this match? (match against known companies: ${companyList || "none"})
- What status update should be made?
- What follow-up action is needed and by when?

### Suggested Response Draft
Write a brief, professional reply (3-5 sentences) appropriate for this email type.

${autoUpdatePipeline ? "\n**Suggested pipeline changes:** After classifying, list the exact fields this email implies should change, and the application id, for the user to confirm before anything is written." : ""}`,
                }],
        };
    });

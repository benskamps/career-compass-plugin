**Instructions for Claude:**
Extract structured career data from this document. Extract only what it says: copy numbers
and wording exactly, and never fill a field the document doesn't support. A metric the
document doesn't give is \`"[confirm: metric?]"\`, not an estimate. Leave proficiency out
unless the document rates the skill. A recommendation's quote must be verbatim.

Produce output in two formats:

### 1. Human-Readable Summary
What are the key achievements, skills, and attributes this document states? Then list the
two or three vaguest claims as questions to ask me (team size, a number, my exact part).

### 2. Career KB YAML Block
Extract into YAML format ready to add to the Career KB:

\`\`\`yaml
# Extracted from ${documentType} — ${associatedCompany ?? "Unknown Company"} — ${datePeriod ?? "Unknown period"}
experience_entry:
  role: "${associatedRole ?? "Unknown"}"
  company: "${associatedCompany ?? "Unknown"}"
  achievements:
    - metric: "[the outcome, exactly as the document states it]"
      context: "[situation or task, from the document]"
      impact: "[why it mattered, only if the document says]"
      keywords: []
    # ... additional achievements

testimonials:
  - source: "[name and title if from recommendation/review]"
    relationship: "[manager/peer/report]"
    quote: "[direct quote if available]"
    context: "[what this was about]"
\`\`\`

### 3. Skills Identified
List any skills surfaced by this document that may not be in the Career KB:
\`\`\`yaml
skills:
  - name: "[skill]"
    category: "[Technical/Leadership/Domain/etc]"
    # proficiency: only if the document rates it
\`\`\`

### 4. Keywords Extracted
Top 10 ATS-friendly keywords from this document.

**Rejection message:**
${embedUntrusted("rejection message", rejectionContent)}

---

**Instructions for Claude:**
Write a rejection response that achieves: **${responseGoal}**

**Tone guidelines:**
- Gracious, never bitter
- Genuine, not sycophantic
- Brief (3-5 sentences max)
- Memorable without being awkward
- Mention only what the rejection message or I have said about the process. Don't invent a conversation, an interviewer's name, or a detail of the interviews
${hadGoodRapport ? "- Reference the positive experience, using a specific detail only if the message or I gave one; otherwise keep it general" : ""}

**For goal: ${responseGoal}:**
${responseGoal === "keep_door_open" ? "Express appreciation, mention you'd welcome future opportunities, leave a positive final impression" : ""}
${responseGoal === "request_feedback" ? "Politely ask what the deciding factor was — make it easy to say no, so they'll actually respond" : ""}
${responseGoal === "decline_gracefully" ? "If you're withdrawing after a rejection arrived simultaneously, thank them and close cleanly" : ""}
${responseGoal === "express_continued_interest" ? "Mention the company is still high on your list and you'd welcome being considered for future openings" : ""}

**Output:**
1. **Recommended response** (ready to send)
2. **Alternative version** (different angle)
3. **LinkedIn connection note** (if you haven't connected yet — 300 chars)

Lead with the recommended response, ready to copy; keep any commentary to one line after the drafts.

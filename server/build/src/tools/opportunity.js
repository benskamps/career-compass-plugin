**Instructions for Claude:**
Assess this posting against the career context above. The job of this tool is an *honest*
verdict, not an encouraging one. Job boards score fit from keyword overlap and get it wrong
in both directions — they call a role a strong match when it pays below the floor, and they
bury a role that actually fits. So check the posting against the whole preference contract
above (salary band, remote, relocation, notice period, target company size), not just the
role titles and skills.

One rule governs the whole contract: **"not set" means the user has not told us, and an
unanswered question is never a constraint.** Do not fill it in with a sensible-sounding
default, do not reason as if the answer were "no", and do not let it move the fit score in
either direction. Name what is missing and ask for it. Inventing a preference and then
ruling a job out on it is the exact failure this tool exists to prevent.

### 1. Fit Score (X/10)
Overall match with a one-line rationale. Score against the *whole* contract: a role that
matches on skills but misses the salary floor or the location constraint is not an 8.

### 2. Compensation Check
Compare the posting's compensation to the salary band above, explicitly:
- Quote the posting's number or range, then say **above the band / inside the band / below the floor**, with the figures side by side.
- If the posting gives no compensation at all, say **"posting silent on comp"** in those words. Do not infer, estimate, or borrow a number from elsewhere. Say when in the process to ask, and what to ask for.
- If the band above reads "not set", say so plainly and note that the compensation half of this verdict is unverifiable until it is filled in.

### 3. Location & Remote Check
Compare the posting's location and onsite expectation to **Open to remote** and **Open to relocation** above:
- **If either reads "not set", the user has never answered it.** Do not treat it as a constraint, do not assume a default, and do not rule the role in or out on it. Say which answer is missing and ask for it — an unanswered question is not a "no".
- Onsite or hybrid in a place they have **stated** they will not relocate to → that is a blocker, name it as one, not as a footnote.
- Remote role and they have stated they are open to remote → say it is clear, and check whether the posting hides a geographic or timezone restriction.
- Posting vague or silent on location → say so and put it at the top of the questions to ask.

### 4. Skills Match
5-7 specific points where the background directly maps to what they are asking for. Quote from both the posting and the career history.

### 5. Skill Gaps
Every requirement in the posting that the career context does not evidence. For each: (a) how significant, (b) whether it is a dealbreaker, (c) how to address it. Do not soften this section — an unlisted gap is one they find in the interview instead.

### 6. Verdict vs. the Source Label
${sourceFitLabel
                        ? `Open this section with exactly one of: **Agree with the label**, **Disagree — the board is over-calling this**, or **Disagree — the board is under-calling this**. Then justify it against sections 2, 3, and 5, and rule in both directions:
- Board says strong match, but comp misses the floor / location is a blocker / a dealbreaker gap exists → say the board is wrong, and say which check it ignored.
- Board says weak or partial match, but the preference contract and the skills actually line up → say the board is wrong, and say what it under-weighted (career-changer profiles and non-obvious title mappings are where boards fail most).
- If you agree, say so plainly and name the single thing that would flip the verdict.`
                        : `No job-board label was supplied for this posting. State the label you would expect a keyword-matching board to show for it, and where that matcher would most likely mislead — over-calling on title overlap, or under-calling because the transferable evidence is worded differently. Re-run this tool with \`sourceFitLabel\` to check a specific board's claim.`}

### 7. Talking Points
5 things to lead with in conversations about this role, framing the background in their language.

### 8. Day in the Life
Based on the posting, describe the first 90 days and a typical week in this role. What problems would they own? What would success look like?

### 9. Red Flags / Questions
Anything in the posting that warrants clarification or concern.

### 10. Verdict
Pursue or not? The strategic case for or against, stated in one paragraph. If any check in sections 2, 3, or 5 came back as a blocker, the verdict has to reckon with it rather than route around it.

/**
 * The user's stated hard constraints, rendered for the prompt.
 *
 * These live in `profile.yaml` and, until this existed, reached exactly one
 * prompt path: `research_company` printed `openToRemote` and nothing else. So
 * `explore_opportunity` — the tool whose entire output is a fit verdict — scored
 * fit on roles, industries and skills, and never once saw the salary floor or
 * the relocation answer. That is the same keyword-overlap fit a job board
 * computes, which is precisely what the user came here to have checked.
 *
 * Absent values are printed as "not set" rather than omitted. A missing line
 * reads as "no constraint" to a model; "not set" reads as "unknown", which is
 * the truth, and lets the instructions ask for the gap to be named.
 *
 * The two booleans need that distinction more than anything else here, and used
 * to lose it. They were `z.boolean().default(…)`, so an unanswered profile
 * parsed to `openToRemote: true, openToRelocation: false` and this function
 * printed "yes"/"no" — indistinguishable from a stated answer, under a heading
 * calling them hard constraints, with section 3 downstream instructed to treat a
 * location mismatch as a blocker. A first-run profile is name + summary only, so
 * the tool ruled roles out on a preference the user had never given. They are
 * `.optional()` now and `undefined` prints as "not set" like everything else.

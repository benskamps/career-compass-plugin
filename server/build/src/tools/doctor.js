 * - It fails soft. A timeout, a DNS failure, an offline laptop, a corporate
 *   proxy returning HTML — all resolve to `{ ok: false }` with a human reason,
 *   never a thrown error. Being offline is not a problem with your install, and
 *   a health check that reports it as one is worse than no health check.

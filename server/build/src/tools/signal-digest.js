/**
 * Render a compact, prompt-ready digest of recent career-journal signals.
 *
 * This is how the accruing KB *compounds visibly*: the raw journal is part of
 * the full KB JSON, but models attend to a short, clearly-labeled section far
 * better than to a nested array buried in a large blob. So we surface the most
 * recent N entries plus a tally of recurring signals, with explicit guidance to
 * use them (and not to fabricate from them).
 *
 * Returns "" when there is nothing to show, so callers can inject it
 * unconditionally without adding an empty heading on first-run KBs.

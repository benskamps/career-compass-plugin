 * recent N entries plus a tally of recurring signals, with explicit guidance to
 * use them (and not to fabricate from them).
 *
 * When the caller knows which company the work is for, that company's entries
 * come first and the rest of the window is the most recent others. Without it,
 * prep for a second Veridian round could show six newer notes about other
 * companies and none of the debrief from the first round.
 *
 * Returns "" when there is nothing to show, so callers can inject it
 * unconditionally without adding an empty heading on first-run KBs.

/**
 * The one honesty rule every tool that drafts words in the user's voice carries.
 *
 * The offline evals (eval-src/) found the failure is rarely a made-up job. It is
 * embroidery: a drafted bullet that adds an audience ("for non-technical
 * stakeholders"), a domain ("a regulated launch", "a money-movement product"), an
 * outcome the résumé never claimed, a rounded-up tenure, or an assumption about the
 * user's situation ("that chapter is behind me"). Each one reads as plausible
 * polish, and each one is something the user could be asked about in an interview.
 * The tools that draft (résumé, cover letter, interview prep, offer review, fit
 * check) append this block so the rule is stated once, the same way, everywhere.

export const TRUTH_RULE = `**Truth rule (applies to everything you write about me):**
- Every fact about me must come from the Career KB above or from what I have said in this conversation. Copy numbers exactly; never round them up or turn "under 0.5%" into "zero".
- In drafted résumé bullets, letters, and interview answers, do not add context the source does not state: no new audience, domain, scope, outcome, tool, responsibility, or reason. Rewording is fine; new facts are not.
- Use the posting's words only where my history says the same thing. "Owned demand generation" is not "owned pipeline targets", and "wrote a findings report" is not "presented findings". Never write "you ask for X, Y and Z; I did all three" unless each one is in my history.
- Don't label my work beyond what the source says: not B2B or consumer, not technical or non-technical, not W2 or 1099, not coursework or on-the-job, not "money movement" or "regulated". If a label matters for the job, it is a gap to ask about.
- A skills or competencies list holds only skills the source names. Use the posting's wording only where it names the same skill.
- In my voice, never invent my inner life or story: how I felt, what I used to call my work, why I am moving on, how a role changed over time, what a break was like or whether it was planned. Keep tense true: if I am between jobs or on a break, don't write that I use a tool "every day".
- If a stronger version needs a fact you don't have, still write the full draft, and put the missing piece in a short visible placeholder such as [confirm: who used these reports?]. Never state something as fact and also ask me to confirm it; if it needs confirming, it is a placeholder. In a letter, use at most two placeholders and put any other questions after the letter.
- Journal entries marked as Claude's inference are hypotheses: never state them as facts about me.
- The name on an email or document I paste is mine (people apply under nicknames and married names). Don't compare it with an account or system name.
- Things I haven't told you about my situation (work authorization, why a job ended, whether a career break is over, my current equity or bonus) are open questions. Name them as gaps or ask; never assume an answer in my voice.
- Before you send a draft, reread every sentence about me and check that you could point to its source. Cut or bracket anything you can't. Only say "I added nothing" after doing that check.`;
/**
 * For tools that discuss pay. Market figures the model "knows" are unsourced and
 * often stale, and the evals caught offer reviews stating equity norms as fact.
 */
export const MARKET_DATA_RULE = `**Market data rule:** Only cite salary, bonus, or equity benchmarks that appear in the market data above or that I gave you. If there are none, say so plainly, tell me where to get them (Levels.fyi, Glassdoor, Carta's equity benchmarks, a recruiter), and reason from my own numbers and stated targets instead. Never put a dollar value on equity without the company's valuation or price per share and the total share count.`;
/**
 * For tools that talk about a company: research briefs, interview prep, the
 * "why this company" half of a letter. The server never fetches anything, so a
 * brief asked for "funding, Glassdoor themes, interview stages" with no web
 * search available gets those from memory: stale at best, invented at worst,
 * and the user repeats them to an interviewer who knows better.
 */
export const COMPANY_FACTS_RULE = `**Company facts rule:** State a fact about the company (funding, headcount, revenue, leadership, culture, reviews, tech stack, interview stages, recent news) only if it comes from the posting, my notes, or a source you looked up in this conversation, and name that source. If you can't look things up here, say so in one line, then give the brief as what to check and where (their careers page, recent press, LinkedIn, Glassdoor or Blind, people I know there) instead of filling it in from memory. Mark anything older or unsure as "unverified". Never invent interview stages, questions, or employee sentiment.`;
/**
 * How a tool's answer should open. The evals' first-reply axis and the skills
 * both want the answer first, but each tool's section list ran to 7-10 headings
 * with the verdict last, so the shape a user saw depended on which tool ran.
 */
export const RESPONSE_SHAPE = `**Shape of your reply:** Open with the answer in two or three lines (the verdict, the draft, or the one thing to do first), then the detail. Skip any section that would only restate another or that you have nothing specific for. End with one offer of the next step, not a list of options.`;

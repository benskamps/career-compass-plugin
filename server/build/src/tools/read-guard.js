/**
 * Run a store read (`loadCareerData` / `loadPipeline`) and turn a fail-closed
 * corrupt store — or an unavailable write claim — into a told-plainly sentence
 * instead of letting it escape as a raw transport error.
 *
 * This is the read-side twin of the catch blocks every write tool already
 * carries (see pipeline.ts and career-kb.ts). A corrupt `profile.yaml` or
 * `applications.yaml` makes the loader throw `CorruptDataError`; without this,
 * a read-only interview tool surfaced that as a stack trace and lost the one
 * sentence that tells the user to fix or restore the file. The message is the
 * error's own — the loaders write a repair instruction into it — so the caller
 * only has to decide to return `response` instead of proceeding.
 *
 * Anything that is not a recognised store condition is re-thrown: an unexpected
 * failure should still surface, not be swallowed as a friendly message.

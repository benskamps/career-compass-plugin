**Instructions for Claude:**
Generate complete interview prep tailored to a ${interviewType.replace("_", " ")} at ${company ?? "this company"}:

### 1. Opening Pitch (60-90 seconds)
"Tell me about yourself" — tailored specifically to this role and company. Bridge my background to their context.

### 2. STAR Stories
Start from the story bank: where a saved story fits a likely question, use it verbatim and say it is a saved one${career.stories.length ? ", skipping any this company or these interviewers have already heard" : ""}. Only then build new ones, each from a real achievement in the Career KB, written out in full, and offer once to save the new ones to \`stories\`. For each story, provide:
- **Situation:** Brief context
- **Task:** What I was responsible for
- **Action:** What I specifically did (not "we")
- **Result:** The outcome as the Career KB records it, numbers copied exactly. If it records none, write [confirm: result?] rather than a number
- **Best used for:** Which question types this answers

Write 3-5 stories by default, the ones that best match the likely questions; more only if the KB has more strong ones.

Match stories to the likely question themes for ${interviewType}:
${interviewType === "behavioral" ? "- Leadership, conflict, failure, ambiguity, collaboration, influence, growth" : ""}
${interviewType === "technical" ? "- System design, problem-solving approach, debugging, technical decisions" : ""}
${interviewType === "phone_screen" ? "- Background, motivation, salary expectations, availability, logistics" : ""}
${interviewType === "panel" ? "- Cross-functional influence, stakeholder management, communication style" : ""}
${interviewType === "final" ? "- Vision, leadership, company fit, long-term goals, strategic thinking" : ""}
${interviewType === "negotiation" ? "- Compensation expectations, competing processes, start date, what would make me say yes. Use only numbers I have given" : ""}

### 3. Likely Questions (8-12)
Questions specific to ${company ?? "this company"} and ${role ?? "this role"}, with suggested answer angles from my background.

### 4. Questions to Ask (5-7)
Thoughtful questions that demonstrate genuine insight about the role, team, and company. Not generic.

### 5. Company & Role Alignment
How my background connects to what the posting and my notes say about ${company ?? "the company"} and this role. Don't describe their mission, product, or challenges beyond those sources unless you looked them up here.

### 6. Bridge Topics
Non-obvious connections between real items in my history and their world, things that will make me memorable. Each one names the Career KB item it rests on.

### 7. Watch-outs & Reframes
Likely concerns they'll have about my background, and how to address them proactively and honestly.

Before section 1, give me a three-line summary: the one story to lead with, the question I'm most likely to stumble on, and the one thing to prepare first.

**Instructions for Claude:**
Project the **next** interview round from where the last one stopped. This is not general
prep — the value here is continuity: what they have already covered, what they opened and
did not close, and what they have not tested yet.

### 1. Where the Process Actually Stands
Reconstruct the arc from the timeline above in your own words: rounds completed, who was in
each, what each one appeared to be testing. Be explicit about what is *recorded* versus what
you are inferring — if the notes are thin, say the arc is partly guesswork rather than
inventing detail.

### 2. Ground Already Covered — Do Not Repeat
List the questions and themes that have already been asked and answered across the rounds
above. Anything on this list should NOT appear in section 4. Interviewers compare notes;
re-running a story they already have reads as having nothing else. Name the saved stories
already told above by round and by who heard them ("you told Priya that one already"), and
pick different saved stories for the next round.

### 3. Open Threads
Things the last round opened and did not close: a question that got a partial answer, a
follow-up that was promised, a topic an interviewer circled twice, a stumble that was noted
but not resolved. For each, say who owns it and what closing it would look like. These are
the highest-probability next questions, because the interviewer already flagged them.

### 4. Untested Gaps
Cross the posting's requirements${postingText ? " (cached above)" : " (as you understand the role)"} against what the rounds have actually
probed. What has nobody asked about yet? Rank these by how likely the next round is to reach
for them${nextRoundType ? `, given that the next round is a ${nextRoundType.replace(/_/g, " ")}` : ", and say which stage would typically reach for each"}.

### 5. Likely Next-Round Questions (ranked)
8-12 concrete questions the next interviewer is most likely to ask, ordered by probability.
For each: one line on why *this* process points at it (an open thread, an untested gap, a
recurring signal from the journal), and the specific piece of the career history to answer
with. Draw on sections 3 and 4 — do not produce a generic question bank.

### 6. What To Prepare Tonight
The three things worth the preparation time, given the projection above, and the one thing
that would most change their read of you if it landed.

---

After the round happens, capture what they actually asked with \`capture_insight\`
(\`type: "interview_insight"\`${applicationId ? `, \`applicationId: "${applicationId}"\`` : ""}) — including where this projection was wrong. That is
what makes the next projection in this process, and the next process, sharper. ${RECORD_STORY_USE}

- Target bonus (% and $ amount)
- Equity (grant, vesting schedule, cliff; a dollar value only if the valuation or price per share and the share count are known, otherwise list exactly what to ask for)
- Benefits (health, 401k match, PTO, etc.): list what the offer states; put a dollar value only on what it states in dollars
- **Total Year 1 comp**
- **Total Year 4 comp** (fully vested)

### 2. Market Comparison
Compare to market rate for ${role ?? "this role"} at ${company ?? "this company type"}'s stage/size${location ? ` in ${location}` : ""}:
${marketData ? "- Compare against the market data above, citing it\n- How does this offer rank against it?" : "- No market data was provided, so do not state benchmarks or norms. Say so in one line and name where to get it (Levels.fyi, Glassdoor, Carta, a trusted recruiter)\n- Compare instead against my current pay, my stated targets, and any other offers"}

### 3. Negotiation Strategy
- What should I push on first?
- What's likely moveable vs. fixed?
- What's my target and walk-away?
- How does leverage from ${otherOffers ? "competing offers" : "my position"} play in?

### 4. Counter Script
Exact words for the negotiation call, built on a reason that is true for me: ${marketData ? "the market data above" : "my current pay, my stated targets, or another offer, whichever I actually have. No market data was given, so the script must not claim I researched market rates"}${otherOffers ? ", and the competing offer, stated only as specifically as I described it" : ""}. Example shape:
> "Thank you for the offer. I'm excited about the role at ${company ?? "the company"}. Based on [the true reason], I was hoping we could get to [specific number]. Is there flexibility there?"

Provide 2-3 variations depending on their response. Fill the brackets from my data, or leave them as [confirm: ...] placeholders.

### 5. Alternative Asks
If base is firm, what else to ask for:
- Signing bonus
- Equity acceleration or refresh schedule
- Earlier first review
- Additional PTO
- Remote flexibility
- Title adjustment
- Equipment/home office budget

### 6. Decision Framework
Score this offer on: compensation, growth, culture fit, role scope, company trajectory, risk. Score only what my data supports and mark the rest "unknown" with the question that would settle it.
Overall recommendation: Accept / Negotiate / Decline? Put this recommendation and the first thing to negotiate at the very top of your reply, before section 1.

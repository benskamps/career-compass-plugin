/**
 * Today's job-search digest: what `pipeline_view action=next_actions` returns,
 * and what `/career-compass:today` is built on.
 *
 * The old version was a flat, unranked list. On the sample pipeline four months
 * on it printed nine lines, the same application twice ("Follow up" and
 * "Overdue follow-up"), "evaluate and respond" on an offer whose deadline had
 * passed, and "follow up" on applications silent for 110 days. It never named a
 * discovered role left unapplied or a follow-up due tomorrow. A list like that
 * gives nobody a reason to come back the next morning.
 *
 * Now each live application yields at most one item, its most pressing, and the
 * items are ranked. The top one is the "Start here" move; the rest of today's
 * list follows; anything due in the next few days goes under "Coming up". Every
 * item ends with one concrete action the user can take or ask for.

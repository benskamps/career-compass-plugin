**Instructions for Claude:**
Using the Career KB above, generate a tailored resume:

**Structure for ${format} format:**
${format === "standard" ? `1. Header (name, contact, LinkedIn)
2. Professional Summary (3-4 sentences, bridging background to this role)
3. Core Competencies (only skills in the Career KB, in the posting's wording where it names the same skill)
4. Professional Experience (reverse chronological, achievement-focused)
5. ${includeProjects ? "Key Projects\n6. Education & Certifications" : "Education & Certifications"}` : ""}
${format === "federal" ? `1. Header with full contact info
2. Work Experience (detailed, with hours per week, supervisor info)
3. Education
4. Certifications & Training
5. Skills Matrix` : ""}
${format === "academic" ? `1. Header & Contact Information
2. Research Profile / Executive Summary
3. Education & Credentials (degrees, dissertations, honors)
4. Academic Appointments & Research Experience
5. Publications & Peer-Reviewed Works
6. Grants, Fellowships & Awards
7. Teaching Experience, Advising & Curriculum Development
8. Invited Talks, Conference Presentations & Symposia
9. Professional Service, Editorial Roles & Affiliations` : ""}
${format === "functional" ? `1. Header
2. Professional Summary
3. Core Competencies by theme
4. Career Highlights (top 6-8 achievements regardless of employer)
5. Employment History (condensed)
6. Education` : ""}

**Rules:**
- Match the posting's language exactly where truthful
- Lead each achievement with an action verb
- Keep every number the Career KB gives; never add a number it doesn't
- ATS-safe: no tables, columns, headers/footers, graphics
- Do not fabricate — only use data from the Career KB
- Mark anything that needs my confirmation with a [confirm: ...] placeholder
- Industry-agnostic: use the posting's vocabulary, not my previous employer's

Output the full resume text first, ready to copy, then a short "Keyword Match Report" showing which posting requirements are covered and which aren't, then any [confirm: ...] questions in one list.

**Instructions for Claude:**
Write a compelling cover letter. Structure:

**Opening (1 paragraph):** Hook with a specific achievement of mine, or something the posting says about ${company}, that connects to why I'm applying. Don't open with "I am writing to apply" or any version of "I'm applying for the X role".

**Body (2 paragraphs):**
- Para 1: My most relevant experience and its outcome, told plainly from the Career KB
- Para 2: Why ${company} specifically, using only what the posting, my notes, or I have said about them. If that's nothing, make the case about the role and the problems it owns rather than inventing facts about the company

**Closing (1 paragraph):** Confident call to action. Specific, not generic.

**Tone notes for ${tone}:**
${tone === "professional" ? "Polished, measured, authoritative" : ""}
${tone === "conversational" ? "Warm, direct, human — write like you talk" : ""}
${tone === "enthusiastic" ? "High energy, genuine excitement, mission-driven" : ""}
${tone === "concise" ? "Every sentence earns its place. Max 250 words total." : ""}

Keep it under 400 words. Make it feel human, not templated, through plain specific language rather than invented story: each sentence about me is either a fact from the Career KB or a plain statement of what I would bring or want. No scenes, causes, surprises, or lessons the Career KB doesn't give ("when results were stuck", "I didn't call it that at the time"), no "I've always…", and no claims about how I work today unless I am working today.

**Instructions for Claude:**
Reformat the resume content above following the parsing hygiene and the ${ATS_SYSTEM_NAME[targetSystem]} note above. Produce:

1. **Formatted version** — ready to paste into ${targetSystem} fields
2. **Field-by-field breakdown** — if form-based, show exactly what goes in each field
3. **Length check** — flag any section long enough that a form field might cut it off, and say to check that form's limit; never state a character limit as fact
4. **ATS keyword check** — only if the posting text is in this conversation: its top 10 keywords and whether each appears in the formatted output. Otherwise skip this item and say paste the posting to get it
5. **Copy-paste ready sections** — formatted so each section can be directly pasted

Flag any content that doesn't translate well to plain text and suggest alternatives. Reformat only: keep every fact, date, and number exactly as given, and add nothing. Don't add vendor tips beyond the notes above: how each employer configures its system varies, and folklore about a vendor's parser stated as fact sends people chasing the wrong fix.

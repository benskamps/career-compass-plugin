/**
 * Live resources — the conversation notices when the files change underneath it.
 *
 * The product's whole premise is that your career data is plain YAML you can
 * open in an editor, and that a local dashboard can move a card in it. Until
 * now both of those were invisible to the conversation: the model read a
 * resource once, and anything you did outside the chat was gone until you said
 * so out loud. You would edit `applications.yaml` in vim, come back, and be
 * talking to a model holding a stale copy of your own job search.
 *
 * This is the piece of MCP that has no equivalent anywhere else in the stack.
 * A web app owns its state and pushes to a browser. A CLI reads and exits. Here
 * three peers — an editor, a GUI, and a conversation — share one directory of
 * plain files, and none of them owns it. Resource subscriptions are what let
 * the conversation be a real peer in that arrangement instead of a snapshot.
 *
 * ── Honest failure posture ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The notification is advisory. A host that never sends `resources/subscribe`
 * gets a server that behaves exactly as before: the watcher is started lazily
 * by the first subscribe and there is no cost, no thread, and no behaviour
 * change if that never arrives. Whether a given host *acts* on
 * `notifications/resources/updated` by refreshing context is the host's call and
 * not something this server can claim on its behalf — so nothing in the
 * user-facing copy promises it. What is promised here is narrow and true: if you
 * subscribe, you are told.

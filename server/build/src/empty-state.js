 * The one message a user sees before they have any career data.
 *
 * There used to be four different ones, and the only one carrying an
 * instruction gave two wrong facts in twenty words: it named `data/career/`,
 * a repo-relative path that exists nowhere on an installed user's machine, and
 * it told them to run `ingest_document`, which by design never writes anything.
 * So the first thing a new user saw was a dead end that also lied about where
 * their files live.
 *
 * This names the actual resolved directory — the server knows it — and offers
 * a first move that works: `save_career_section`, which is the only tool that
 * writes the Career KB.

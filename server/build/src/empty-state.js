/**
 * What a KB-backed tool returns before the user has saved any career data.
 *
 * There used to be four different ones, and the only one carrying an
 * instruction gave two wrong facts in twenty words: it named `data/career/`, a
 * repo-relative path that exists nowhere on an installed user's machine, and it
 * told them to run `ingest_document`, which by design never writes anything.
 *
 * Its successor named the real folder and told the *user* "nothing is there so
 * far, paste a resume and ask me to save it". But the reader of a tool result is
 * the model, and this arrives at the worst moment: the user has just pasted a
 * résumé and a posting and asked a question. Setup copy there pulled the reply
 * into "your KB is empty, let's save it first" instead of the answer (council
 * 2.9.7, activation note). So it now speaks to the model: an empty KB is normal,
 * do the task from what the user pasted, then offer the save once.
 *
 * `resumeParam` is for the tools that accept pasted résumé text (`resume` on
 * explore_opportunity and tailor_resume): the cheapest correct move there is to
 * call the same tool again with it.

 * The write claim — one process at a time may write a given data directory.
 *
 * `withDataLock` in file-store.ts serializes read-modify-write cycles *within a
 * process*, and its own comment is honest about that scope: "the MCP server is
 * the single writer for a given data dir. It is not a defense against two
 * servers pointed at one directory." The audit's finding was that the
 * repository ships the second writer itself — the Next dashboard's four Server
 * Actions run in their own OS process — so the invariant was stated and not
 * held. The same class covers one MCP server registered in both Claude Desktop
 * and Claude Code, which is an ordinary install, not an exotic one.
 *
 * Two concurrent read-modify-write cycles on profile.yaml interleave, the later
 * rename wins outright, and both callers report success. The `.bak` makes that
 * recoverable; it does not make it *detectable*, which is the worse half.
 *
 * ── What this is and is not ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It is a cooperative advisory claim: a file in the data directory naming the
 * pid and a nonce, created with `wx` so creation is atomic on every platform.
 * A writer that cannot take the claim refuses and says who holds it, rather
 * than writing anyway.
 *
 * It is NOT a kernel lock and cannot stop a process that ignores it — `vim`
 * editing the YAML by hand will not consult it, and that is fine, because a
 * human editing their own plain files is the product working as advertised.
 * What it stops is the two writers this repository itself ships.
 *
 * ── Staleness ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A crashed process leaves its claim behind. A claim that outlives its holder
 * would wedge the store forever, which is a worse failure than the race it
 * prevents, so a stale claim is breakable. Staleness is a two-tier rule: a claim
 * whose holder's pid is no longer alive is broken at once (a crash never wedges
 * the store), while a claim whose pid still looks alive is left alone as a
 * slow-but-real writer — UNTIL {@link CLAIM_HARD_TTL_MS}, past which even a
 * live-looking pid is broken, because a pid can be reused and a small-YAML write
 * held for minutes is a hung or reused holder, not a real one. The nominal
 * {@link CLAIM_TTL_MS} is deliberately short: a claim is held across one
 * read-modify-write of a small YAML file, single-digit milliseconds, never
 * across a user's think time. If you want to hold one longer, you want a
 * different design, not a longer TTL.
 */

 * A hard upper bound past which a claim is broken even if its pid still looks

 * reassigned to an unrelated live process, `pidAlive` reports "alive" forever,
 * and with liveness winning the claim would never break: the directory wedges
 * permanently, curable only by deleting `.write-claim` by hand. No legitimate
 * write of a small YAML file is held for minutes, so a claim older than this cap
 * is a reused pid or a hung process, and breaking it is strictly safer than a
 * permanent wedge. Far above any real hold (single-digit ms), far below forever.

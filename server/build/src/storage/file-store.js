 * bug this exists to prevent: the load and the save are two separate awaits, so
 * a second call can slip in between and have its write overwritten wholesale.

 * returns whatever the caller needs — handlers keep their ordinary return
 * contract, including the no-op branches ("application not found"), rather than
 * signalling through a thrown sentinel.
 *
 * The write is skipped when the mutator left the pipeline structurally
 * unchanged. `savePipelineUnlocked` stamps a fresh `lastUpdated` and `atomicWriteYaml`
 * copies a full `.bak` on every call, so a no-op branch that wrote anyway would
 * spend a backup and move the clock to record that nothing happened.
 *
 * A CorruptDataError from the load propagates untouched: nothing is written,
 * so an unreadable file is never overwritten. A WriteClaimUnavailableError
 * likewise propagates before the load runs — another process owns this
 * directory, so the honest outcome is "unavailable", not a second writer.
